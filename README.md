# FastTyping

FastTyping is a productivity extension for Visual Studio Code that helps you type faster by automatically replacing custom character sequences with predefined symbols or snippets ‚Äî in real time as you type.

Whether you're coding or writing documentation, FastTyping helps reduce keystrokes and makes repetitive typing smoother.

## üí° Example Use Case

- Typing `--` instantly becomes `->`
- Typing `;;` in a `.php` file becomes `.`

## üöÄ Features

- üîÅ Replaces character sequences live as you type
- üß† Language-aware (based on file extension, like `php`, `js`, etc.)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easily configurable through `settings.json`
- ü™∂ Lightweight and intuitive

## ‚öôÔ∏è Default Shortcuts

FastTyping comes with built-in default shortcuts, divided into common (global) and language-specific groups:

### üîÅ Common Shortcuts (applies to all file types)

| Typed | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `--`  | `->`   |
| `√†√†`  | `@`    |
| `√π√π`  | `%`    |

### üêò PHP-Specific Shortcuts

| Typed | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `;;`  | `.`    |
| `**`  | `{}`   |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Shortcuts

You can fully customize the shortcuts through your **VS Code User Settings** (`settings.json`).

### üëâ Steps:
1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Search for and select: **Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)** or **FastTyping: Open Extension Configuration**
3. Add or modify your configuration under the following key:

```json
"fasttyping.shortcuts": {
  "common": {
    "--": "->",
    "√†√†": "@",
    "√π√π": "%",
    ">>": "‚Üí"
  },
  "php": {
    ";;": ".",
    "**": "{}"
  },
  "javascript": {
    "cl": "console.log()"
  }
}
```
You can override, add or remove any shortcut per language or globally under "common".

### ‚ùå To disable a default shortcut

To disable a default shortcut, simply remove its entry from the configuration.
For example, to disable the `--` shortcut in the common group and the `;;` shortcut for PHP:

```json
"fasttyping.shortcuts": {
  "common": {
    // "--" has been removed
    "√†√†": "@",
    "√π√π": "%"
  },
  "php": {
    // ";;" has been removed
    "**": "{}"
  }
}
```
Once removed, FastTyping will no longer trigger those shortcuts.
